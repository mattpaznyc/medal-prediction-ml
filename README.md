# Medal-Prediction-Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the medal count in the Summer Olympics using a linear regression algorithm. By analyzing the number of athletes and previous medal counts, the model attempts to forecast the medal count for future events. The project achieved a mean absolute error of approximately 3.3, indicating reasonable accuracy in its predictions. However, further optimizations and enhancements are planned to improve the model's performance.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the medal count in the Summer Olympics. The project currently employs a linear regression algorithm with two main predictors: the number of athletes and previous medal counts. By analyzing historical data, the model provides valuable insights into the potential medal count for future events. The achieved mean absolute error of approximately 3.3 demonstrates the model's initial success, but further improvements are anticipated.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information on sports events, including the number of athletes and the corresponding medal counts. Prior to model training, the dataset underwent a cleaning process to remove missing values and handle infinite values. This ensures the integrity and reliability of the data used for predictions.
